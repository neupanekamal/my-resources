```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Read in data 

```{r}
#Load data
surveys <- read_csv("diversity.csv")
```

### Tidyverse Day 1

#### Q1: What is the class of the object surveys? 

```{r}
#Q1
class(surveys)
nrow(surveys)
ncol(surveys)
```
Survey is a data frame. 

#### Q2: How many rows and how many columns are in the object?
Number of rows: 34786
Number of columns: 13


#### Q2: Create a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.

```{r}
#Q2
surveys_200 <- surveys[200,]
```

#### Q3: Create a data.fram (surveys_last) containing only the data in the last row of the surveys dataset using nrow() instead of the row number. 

```{r}
#Q3
surveys_last <- surveys[nrow(surveys),]

```

#### Q4: Change the columns taxa and genus in the surveys data frame into a factor.

```{r}
#Q4
surveys$genus <- factor(surveys$genus)
surveys$taxa <- factor(surveys$taxa)
summary(surveys$genus)


```

#### Q5: Using the functions you learned before

##### Q5 A: How many rabbits were observed? 

```{r}
#Q5A
summary(surveys)
```
There were 75 rabbits.

##### Q5 B: How many different genera are in the genus column?

```{r}
#Q5B
nlevels(surveys$genus)
```
There were 26 different genera.  
#### Q6: Create new variable 'sex' by converting surveys$sex to a factor. Use addNA to add a factor level to 'sex' variable. Using the 'sex' variable, rename "NA", "F", and "M" factors to "undetermined", "female", and "male" respectively. Plot sex variable. 

```{r}
#Q6
sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
summary(sex)
nlevels(sex)
sex <- addNA(sex)
levels(sex) <- c('male', 'female', 'undetermined')
plot (sex)

```

#### Q7: Recreate the barplot such that "undetermined" is first (before "female").

```{r}
#Q7
sex1 <- factor(sex, levels=c('male', 'undetermined', 'female'))
plot(sex1)
```

#### Q8: Using pipes, subset the surveys data to include animals collected before 1995 and retain only the columns year, sex, and weight. View the tail() of the data.frame.

```{r}
#Q8
subset_surveys <- surveys %>% 
  filter(year < 1995) %>% 
    select(year, sex, weight)
subset_surveys
tail(subset_surveys)
```

### Tidyverse Day 2

#### Q9: Create a new data frame from the surveys data that meets the following criteria:

##### Contains only the species_id column and a new column called hindfoot_cm which contains the hindfoot_length values (currently in mm) converted to centimeters. In this hindfoot_cm column, there are no NAs and all values are less than 3.\

#### View the head() of the data.frame. 

##### Hint: Think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame! 

```{r}
#Q9 
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
  select(species_id, hindfoot_length) %>%
  mutate(hindfoot_cm = hindfoot_length / 10) %>%
  select(species_id, hindfoot_cm) %>%
  filter(hindfoot_cm < 3.0)


```

#### Q10: How many animals were caught in each plot_type surveyed?

```{r}
#Q10
count(surveys, plot_type)
```

#### Q11: Use group_by() and summarize() to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species (using species_id). Also add the number of observations (hint: see ?n).

```{r}
#Q11
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length))%>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_hfl = mean(hindfoot_length), 
            min_hfl = min(hindfoot_length), 
            max_hfl = max(hindfoot_length),
            number_observations = n())


```

#### Q12: What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns year, genus, species_id, and weight.

```{r}
#Q12
surveys_year <- select(surveys, year, genus, species_id, weight)
surveys_year %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(max_wt = max(weight, na.rm=TRUE))
#or
surveys%>%
  filter(!is.na(weight))%>%
select(year, genus, species_id, weight)%>%
group_by(year)%>%
summarize(max_wt=max(weight))
  
```

#### Q13: Reshape the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, and use the function n_distinct() to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. Itâ€™s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.

```{r}
#Q13
survey_13 <- select(surveys, year, plot_id, genus)
survey_13_wider <- survey_13 %>%
  group_by(year, plot_id) %>%
summarize(genera_per_plot = n_distinct(genus)) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = genera_per_plot)
survey_13_wider



```

#### Q14: Now take that data frame and pivot_longer() it, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.

```{r}
#Q14
survey_13_wider %>%
pivot_longer(names_to = "year", values_to =  "genera_per_plot", cols = -plot_id)
```
